Simple, Incremental SAT Solving as a Library
============================================

This Haskell library provides an implementation of the
Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm for the boolean
satisfiability problem. It not only allows to solve boolean formulas
in one go but also to add constraints and query bindings of variables
incrementally.

The implementation is not sophisticated at all but uses the basic DPLL
algorithm with unit propagation.
